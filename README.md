# Crewhelm

Crewhelm is an open-source personal control plane for creating and operating AI agents on
Cloudflare. It is designed to be administered through MCP, with a bootstrap CLI and declarative,
shareable agent recipes.

The repository is currently establishing its engineering and security foundation. No usable
agent runtime has been released yet.

## Principles

- Personal ownership and simple self-hosting
- Cloudflare-native durable agents
- MCP as the primary administration interface
- Deterministic, deny-by-default capability policy
- Declarative recipes without secrets or executable code
- Small, independently validated changes

## Development

Use Node.js 24.18.0 and the pinned pnpm version:

```sh
corepack enable
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm verify
```
