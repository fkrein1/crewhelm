# Crewhelm

Crewhelm is an open-source personal control plane for creating and operating AI agents on
Cloudflare. It is designed to be administered through MCP, with a bootstrap CLI and declarative,
shareable agent recipes. Composio supplies the broad app and web integration plane, including
toolkits such as Firecrawl.

The repository is implementing its first Cloudflare runtime slices. A deployable health Worker is
available, but no usable agent runtime has been released yet.

## Principles

- Personal ownership and simple self-hosting
- Cloudflare-native durable agents
- Composio-backed app and web tools instead of hand-built integrations
- MCP as the primary administration interface
- Deterministic, deny-by-default capability policy
- Declarative recipes without secrets or executable code
- Small, independently validated changes

## Development

Use Node.js 24.18.0 and the pinned pnpm version:

```sh
corepack enable
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm verify
```

## Architecture and philosophy

- [Product philosophy](docs/product/philosophy.md) explains how Crewhelm chooses and shapes work.
- [System architecture](docs/architecture/system.md) defines ownership, runtime boundaries, and
  dependency direction.
- [Code philosophy](docs/engineering/code-philosophy.md) defines the project's standard for
  simple, complete implementations.
- [Decision records](docs/decisions/) capture durable choices without turning routine work into
  process.
